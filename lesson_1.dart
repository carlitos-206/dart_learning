// this is the manner in which dart programs are written

// void isn't needed for single executions but in a larger program void tells the program to run first
// keep for practice
void main(){
  String firstName = 'Carlos'; // Statically type variable 
  var lastName = 'Caceres'; // This is a type inferer Variable
  print('$firstName $lastName'); // This is a Template literal
}
